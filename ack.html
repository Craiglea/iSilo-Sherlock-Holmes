<h3>Sources &amp; Acknowledgements</h3>

<p>I would like to thank Olivia Adler for permission to use the excellent images from the Pinacotheca Holmesiana website within each book.</p>

<p>The text is mostly from the University of Adelaide&#8217;s Open Sources with Project Gutenburg sources used for reference.</p>

<p>The text of the Arthur Conan Doyle biography is from Wikipedia. For anyone interested in a more detailed biography of ACD I would thoroughly recommend Owen Dudley Edwards&#8217; <i>The Quest For Sherlock Holmes</i>, originally published by Mainstream Publishing.</p>

<p>Finally, I do welcome any corrections to these books. Please e-mail them to me using the address given in the iSilo publisher data.</p>
